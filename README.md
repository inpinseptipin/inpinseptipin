# About me
I am Inpinseptipin and i am a graduate student and Teaching Assistant at University of Miami pursuing Masters in Music Engineering Technology.
I am a beatboxer and a looper, I obsess about writing good C++ code and how convieniently its the language audio programming is done on. It do be like that sometimes.

# Projects
I am currently working on an Audio Library called AuxPort. Some people call it me "Reinventing the wheel", I call it "Learning how to make shit". I mean gotta start somewhere :3
The library aims to provide Utility functions to make audio software development a little bit easier. 

# Contribution
If anyone out there is interested in spending their time developing and implementing DSP algorithms. Contact me on Github.
